        <p>Meschino Wellness Account Privacy Statement</p>
        
        <p>Meschino Health & Wellness (thereafter referred to as “Meschino Wellness”) is committed to protecting your
          privacy. This privacy statement applies to the personal information (which includes personal health
          information) collected by the Meschino Wellness Platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>Introduction</b></h2>
        <p>
          <b>The Meschino Wellness Platform is intended for educational purposes only. It is a tool that can help users
            develop their own personal wellness plan, but does not replace the requirement to seek medical evaluation,
            lifestyle advice and treatment from a medical professional.</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Meschino Wellness Platform provides targeted nutrition and lifestyle content by collecting and analyzing
          personal health data, which you may wish to share with your medical doctor and other healthcare professionals
          who help manage your health. It can collect, analyze and store many different types of information such as
          medication use, immunization records, data originating from health and fitness devices (including pedometers,
          blood glucose monitors, blood pressure monitors) and from other applications (such as chronic management
          applications, fitness training applications, weight loss applications, blood pressure applications and more).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Importantly, The Meschino Wellness Platform cannot detect or help manage food or drug allergies, food
          sensitivities or intolerances. In these cases, and other cases involving health conditions of the intestinal
          tract (i.e. active ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric by-pass surgery etc.) you must seek nutritional
          guidance from your medical practitioner or designated registered dietician.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>Integration</b></h2>
        <p>
          You can utilize components of the Meschino Wellness Platform directly to view and manage your health
          information, or you can use selected websites and devices that have been created by application providers and
          device manufacturers to work with Meschino Wellness. Several mechanisms allow you to manage how your health
          information can be accessed, used and shared.
          Meschino Wellness provides you with the technology and services to assist you in collecting, storing and
          analyzing your health related information online. It is a technology platform that allows access by multiple
          applications and devices, in order to work with your health data to improve personal health literacy and
          overall wellness.

        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>Collection of Personal Information</b></h2>
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness asks you to enter an identifier and password to sign in. The first time you sign in to
          Meschino Wellness, Meschino Wellness asks you to create an account. To create an account, you must provide
          personal information such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code and country/region. Meschino
          Wellness may request other optional information, but Meschino Wellness will clearly indicate that such
          information is optional.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>How Meschino Wellness uses your personal information</b></h2>
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness commits to use or disclose personal information collected through Meschino Wellness,
          including personal health information, exclusively to provide Meschino Wellness services (which includes the
          billing, support, maintenance and incident resolution services) and as described in this privacy statement,
          unless expressly otherwise agreed to by you. Usage of the personal information (including personal health
          information) for the provision of Meschino Wellness solutions includes that Meschino Wellness may use your
          personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to provide you with information about Meschino Wellness, including updates, and notifications
          </li>
          <li>
            to send you Meschino Wellness e-mail communication, if any.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness occasionally hires other companies to provide services on its behalf, such as answering
          customer questions about products and services. Meschino Wellness gives those companies only the personal
          information they need to deliver the service. Meschino Wellness requires the companies to maintain the
          confidentiality of the personal information and prohibits them from using such information for any other
          purpose.
          <br />
          In addition, Meschino Wellness may use and/or disclose your personal information if Meschino Wellness believes
          such action is necessary to comply with applicable legislation or legal process served on Meschino Wellness.
          <br />
          Personal information collected on Meschino Wellness is stored and processed in on servers in Canada or the
          United State.
          <br />Meschino Wellness has processes and employees (i.e. Head of Privacy and other resources) whose
          responsibility is to ensure the protection of your privacy and to notify you in the event that Meschino
          Wellness becomes aware of a breach affecting your personal information.

        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>How Meschino Wellness uses aggregate information and statistics</b></h2>
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness may use aggregated information from Meschino Wellness to identify and compare the status of
          specific common health issues as compared to other bench marks established in the specified industry or
          organization. This data is represented as a percent of the entire organization only. This aggregated
          information is not associated with any individual account and would not identify you. Meschino Wellness will
          not use or disclose your individual account and record information from Meschino Wellness.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>Account access and controls</b></h2>
        <p>
          The decision to create an account with Meschino Wellness is yours. The required account information consists
          of a small amount of information such as your name, e-mail address, region and Meschino Wellness credentials.
          Meschino Wellness may request other optional information, but clearly indicates that such information is
          optional. You can review and update your account information. You can modify, add or delete any optional
          account information by signing into your Meschino Wellness account and editing your account profile.
          <br />When you close your account (by signing into your Meschino Wellness account and editing your account
          profile), Meschino Wellness deletes all Records for which you are the sole Custodian. Meschino Wellness waits
          90 days before permanently deleting your account information in order to help avoid accidental or malicious
          removal of your health information.
          <br />When a user with "View and modify" or Custodian access deletes a piece of health information, Meschino
          Wellness archives the information so that it is visible only to Record of Custodians. Solutions and other
          users with whom you have shared your information, but who are not Custodians of the Record, are not able to
          see archived health information.

        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>E-mail controls</b></h2>
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness may send you e-mail communications. You will only receive these communications because you
          have authorized Meschino Wellness do so. If you do not want to receive this information, you can unsubscribe
          through a link at the bottom of the newsletter.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>
          <b>Security of your personal information</b></h2>
        <p>
          Meschino Wellness is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. Meschino Wellness is
          hosted on a robust industry leading hosting partner. The hosting platform meets a broad set of international
          and industry-specific compliance standards, such as ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC 1 and SOC 2, as well as
          country-specific standards including Australia IRAP, UK G-Cloud, and Singapore MTCS. The hosting partner was
          also the first to adopt the uniform international code of practice for cloud privacy, ISO/IEC 27018, which
          governs the processing of personal information by cloud service providers.
          <br />
          Rigorous third-party audits, such as by the British Standards Institute, verify the hosting platforms
          adherence to the strict security controls these standards mandate. As part of our commitment to transparency,
          you can verify our implementation of many security controls by requesting audit results from the certifying
          third parties or through our Host Platform account representative.
